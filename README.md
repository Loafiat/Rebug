# Rebug
A Gorilla Tag mod that reactivates the Debug UI used by the developers of the game, useful for mod development. 

## NOTE:
I will not maintain this mod, considering it's literally three lines of code it probably won't break but in case it does: I give full permission to anyone to fix it and republish the fix.

## Usage:
Press the secondary button on your left controller ((Y) on quest) to change debug mode. There are three modes, basic, logging, and inactive, all pretty self explainatory.
