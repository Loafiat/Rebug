A Gorilla Tag mod that reactivates the Debug UI used by the developers of the game, useful for mod development. 

## NOTE:
I will **not** maintain this mod, considering it's literally *three lines* of code it probably won't break but in case it does: **I give full permission to anyone to fix it and republish the fix**.

## Usage:
Press the **secondary button** on your left controller to change debug mode. There are three modes, basic, logging, and inactive, all pretty self explainatory.
